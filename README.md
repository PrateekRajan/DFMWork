Tracking Server gets request in form of GET and POST request and parses the necessary information from the request received and then puts the parsed data into database of your choice.

Revision 1.1(Completed)

In Revision 1.1 the GET request is handled properly with Sqlite and the dumping database.

Revision 1.2(In Progress)

In Revision 1.2 the intent is to use databases like MongoDB & HBase as dumping databases.
